# Predicting-Melbourne-apartment-prices

Background: Buying your first home can be a big investment so it is important to understand the factors that could affect the housing market in Melbourne. Ideally, a machine learning model can be used to provide an estimate of the price of an apartment of interest so users can make informed decsions when purchasing property and minimize the risk that a seller was underquoting prices.

Results: A Python script was used to scrape real estate data (from a well-established real estate agency) for 2 bedroom apartments (under 1 million dollars). I then performed some data cleaning, basic exploratory data analysis, created a folium map based on addresses to visualize the locations of the different properties. Lastly, I am in the process of training a machine learning model for apartment price predictions based on specific attributes of an apartment (e.g. number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location etc...).
